# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Milan Sebastian

I'm a Computer Science graduate focused on building practical ML tools and automation systems.

I enjoy working on:
- Applied machine learning with explainability (Grad-CAM, CNN + Transformers)
- Web automation and scripting for real-world workflows
- Projects that simplify complex processes through clean engineering

### ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
- [Chest X-ray Classifier](https://github.com/Milanseban/chest-xray-classifier): Hybrid deep learning system with Grad-CAM visualizations for disease detection
- [Just Eat Glitch Scanner](https://github.com/Milanseban/justeat-glitch-scanner): Web automation tool to detect pricing anomalies on public menus
- [Distributed Group Chat System](https://github.com/Milanseban/distributed-group-chat): A terminal-based Python client-server chat app demonstrating socket programming and 
  threading in distributed systems.
- [ML Regression & Classification Toolkit](https://github.com/Milanseban/ml-regression-classification): A clean, modular notebook demonstrating regression (housing prices) and 
  classification (Titanic survival) using Scikit-learn pipelines.

##  What I'm Into

Currently exploring lightweight deployment and more practical use cases in ML + automation.
