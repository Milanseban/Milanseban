# Hi, I'm Milan Sebastian

I am a Computer Science graduate focused on **machine learning**, **full-stack development**, and **automation tools**.  
My projects aim to be practical, explainable, and engineered with clean, maintainable design.

## Core Skills

- **Machine Learning & AI**
  - PyTorch (custom CNNs, Transformers, Grad-CAM explainability)
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM orchestration (LangChain, FAISS)
  - Applied ML workflows: classification, regression, model evaluation

- **Software Engineering**
  - Object-Oriented Programming in Python
  - Building modular, reusable ML and automation pipelines
  - CLI applications and workflow automation
  - GitHub project structuring and version control

- **Full-Stack Development**
  - Django, REST APIs, secure authentication
  - Backend engineering with real-time data handling
  - Frontend integration for dynamic user interfaces

- **Automation**
  - Web automation with Python
  - Workflow simplification through scripting

## Featured Projects

- [**Janus – Private RAG Chatbot**](https://github.com/Milanseban/janus)  
  Private GPT-style assistant that ingests documents, embeds them in FAISS, and answers questions using a quantized LLM. Features conversational memory, offline operation, and page-level source citations.  

- [**Chest X-ray Classifier**](https://github.com/Milanseban/chest-xray-classifier)  
  Hybrid CNN + Transformer model for disease detection in chest X-rays. Includes Grad-CAM visualizations for explainability and evaluation metrics.  

- [**The Grand Belgravia – Hotel Booking Web App**](https://github.com/Milanseban/The-Grand-Belgravia-Hotel)  
  A full-stack Django web application with REST APIs, user authentication, personalized dashboards, and real-time booking availability.  

- [**Just Eat Glitch Scanner**](https://github.com/Milanseban/justeat-glitch-scanner)  
  Web automation tool to scan restaurant menus and detect pricing anomalies.  

- [**Distributed Group Chat System**](https://github.com/Milanseban/distributed-group-chat)  
  Terminal-based Python client-server system using socket programming and threading to demonstrate distributed communication.  

- [**ML Regression & Classification Toolkit**](https://github.com/Milanseban/ml-regression-classification)  
  A notebook project showing clean, modular pipelines for regression (housing prices) and classification (Titanic survival) with Scikit-learn.

## Current Focus
Developing end-to-end systems that combine:
- Machine Learning with explainability and trustworthiness  
- Full-Stack Web Development with strong backends and APIs  
- Automation and scripting for efficiency  
- AI assistant workflows (RAG, private GPTs, multi-agent systems)
